## Getting Started with Pentesting Resources
### Its still under construction and not yet ready as per the usability guidelines provided below

 - ### Take a look inside this Repo
 - ### Reports belonging to different organisations will be listed in Markdown format
 
 - ### Reports will be categorised based on types of application and clients, etc.
 - ### Categories help in narrowing down your search to particular architectures, for example, you are looking for Electron based app pentesting resources - We have removed the clutter and taken the hassle to handpick and list them. 
 
 - ### Latest Reports are being continually added to this Repo so Watch and ðŸŒŸ it!
 
 

 
 
 #### The resources should also be helpful for CTFs, and Vulnerability Assessments apart from Bug Bounty Hunting and Pentesting owing to the rich content and methodologies clearly defined in them. The way they are listed should help you to pick one for your read depending on what you want to test. Over time, more writeups, guides and whitepapers would also be added to this project. Hence, we said - Stay tuned!
